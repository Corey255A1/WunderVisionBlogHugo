This project uses the javascript audio api and websockets. It captures audio and broadcasts it to anyone else on the same channel. Click the Power button to active the audio capture. Click Copy Link to get a link to that channel, or append /channel/[channelname] to the url to specify the channel. Hold down Push-To-Talk to begin transmitting!
