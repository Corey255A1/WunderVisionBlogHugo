This video demonstration of a crazy hat that I had the idea to make. I didn't get it ready in time for New Years as I didn't think of it until the day before. However, here it is in all it's glory. Composed of a couple amplifier circuits using 2n4401 npn transistors a couple 10uf capacitors and a couple resistors the circuit is fairly simple. Sound quality out of the speaker is not that great due to the amplifier simplicity but the volume is quite impressive. The two LED flashlights run on the second amplifier circuit that is tied to the audio amp. It uses a basic passive low pass filter however it's not perfect. Maybe I could refine it a bit and sell them? Hmmm...
