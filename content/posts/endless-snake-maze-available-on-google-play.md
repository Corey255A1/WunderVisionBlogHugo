I've been working on a Android Game.

Each level is generated. Which is really why I started making the game. I have been fascinated with the idea that you can code just some initial recipes and then from the on, it is just generated.

I'm only sure for the first handful of levels because I have been playing them a lot while coding it.

Here is the link to the play store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.endlessmaze.game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.endlessmaze.game)

And here is the excerpt as it was on Cinco de Mayo.

An endless procedurally generated snake maze.

Navigate through the maze and as you approach an end, the map will expand automatically revealing more maze and possible items.

The finish point is algorithmically positioned based on the level. The indicator at the top tells you the distance from that point. Get within a range of 500units of the finish and the finish point will appear.

To unlock the finish line, you must reach the length indicated at the beginning of the level. Once you have reached that length, the finish point will unlock. If you lose power, the finish line still remains unlocked.

The snake will increase in size when eating the red or yellow items.

Colliding with yourself reduces your length by the amount below the collision point.

If you clip the end of your tail, you will a couple pieces.

If you collide with your middle, you will lose half.

If you reverse direction, you will have to restart the level, because you will destroy yourself

And any where in between.... Don't hit yourself

Red Items gain you 1 length.

Yellow Items gain you 10 length

Hammer Items allow you to create a connection when you have reached a dead end only.

Bomb Items, when used, will increase your length by 50, and then explode, creating connections around you and expanding out the map.


You can expand the map at a point by tapping the Binocular power button. This will reveal the map in a greater distance however it will reduce your length by 10.

You can also create connections and expand the map by tapping the Bomb power button. This will turn the piece you are into a cross section, nearby connections into cross sections, make connections and expand out the map. It will reduce your length by 50

There is a Key item that will automatically increase your length to the required length of unlocking the level.

Each level has a Diamond item hidden somewhere.

When each level is completed, it will show up in your menu list. Return to previous levels at any time. Length is not maintained when going to different levels.


Choose your path wisely. #GooglePlay #Android #Games #Snake
