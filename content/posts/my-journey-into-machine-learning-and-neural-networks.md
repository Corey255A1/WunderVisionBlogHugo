The past few months I kind of went on a tangent trying to learn all I can about Machine Learning and Neural Networks. I had felt that I was being left behind on this new emerging technology. So I decided to play catch up. I found a lot of great material along the way and thought I'd compile a list here of some of the things that especially helped me (Because I remembered them in particular). Hopefully this can kind of get you started in your journey to understanding Machine Learning. Youtube MIT Artificial Intelligence Actual Lectures from the course, general topics of artificial intelligence and machine learning https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZBTDzGeGg&index=1&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi Stanford Convolutional Neural Networks Actual Lectures from the course, More on neural nets and present day tech https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv Siraj Raval How to Simulate a Self Driving Car After watching this video, neural networks and how to use Keras really started to click for me. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaY5QiZwSP4 This is the Source from the Video https://github.com/llSourcell/How_to_simulate_a_self_driving_car Executable Downloads for training: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim Books I picked up all for volumes of the Handbook of Artificial Intelligence https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Artificial-Intelligence-Set/dp/0865760047/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516110217&sr=1-7&keywords=handbook+of+artificial+intelligence https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Artificial-Intelligence-IV/dp/0201517310/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516110217&sr=1-4&keywords=handbook+of+artificial+intelligence Artificial Intelligence - Patrick Winston (Lecturer from the MIT Lectures on Youtube) https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Patrick-Winston-1984-04-01/dp/B017WQ22N2/ref=sr_1_sc_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1516110024&sr=1-1-spell&keywords=Patrick+Winstron+Artificial+Intelligence+2nd Learn by Doing Kaggle is a pretty cool website that allows you to try to solve different machine learning challenges. A kernel that I made up why trying to understand how they worked https://www.kaggle.com/wundervision/intro-to-kernels-notebooks-visualizing-data Two pretty good challenges to start off on This is a good way to kind of start understanding how to interpret and process data, and configure it in a way to be useful in machine learning. https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic A couple kernels that were helpful in getting me started to understand processing data -https://www.kaggle.com/neviadomski/titanic-data-exploration-starter -https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions Good way to start understanding Image Classification MNIST dataset https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer Udacity Online Courses Computer Vision Learn more about image processing and detect things with in an image This helped get my head around what is possible in OpenCV https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810 Artificial Intelligence for Robotics This is the first course I started to take on Udacity. It was a little over my head at the time, but now I think I'd get it. I want to restart this one https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373 Things to Install Python, you are going to need to know  most likely, though there are definitely different options. I personally like python https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/ Keras is a layer that makes using Tensor Flow make more sense. You can build networks without the nitty gritty https://keras.io/ https://keras.io/#getting-started-30-seconds-to-keras https://keras.io/applications/ Tensorflow is the backend software that trains the neural networks. There are a few other options out there also, but I just picked this one first, so that is what I'm going to stick with. https://www.tensorflow.org/ https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ OpenCV is a great Computer Vision, image processing library that is available in python. You can process images and live video feed from a webcam https://opencv.org/ Numpy basically helps manipulate arrays, and is needed for OpenCV http://www.numpy.org/ Pandas makes reading in CSV values and building tables easier https://pandas.pydata.org/ #MachineLearning #NeuralNetworks #Udacity #Github #ArtificialIntelligence #Intelligence #SoftwareEngineering #Tutorials #Engineering
