## Introduction
- [Source](https://github.com/Corey255A1/WunderVision-Blog-ASP.Net)

In the [Previous Post](/posts/2023-05-21-asp_blog_razor/) I was rendering the list of posts from the database and created pages to render the individual posts.  

I quickly realized how tedious it was going to be to upload my posts without some kind of front end interface to assist. I could have written a series of scripts but that seemed like it was going to be clunky. This was a good exercise in how to do the C and U part of CRUD.
