# Introduction
- [Source](https://github.com/Corey255A1/Unreal-GingerbreadMan/)  

I have some assets. I have a gingerbread man player. Now I can start building out the level and adding some game play elements!

# Level Building
I first started by deleting most of the base default level and then coloring the ground and boundary pieces white. This gives it a snowy feel.
