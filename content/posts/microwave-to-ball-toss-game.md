I tore apart a microwave. What I wound up with was a nice casing to use for something. I don't have all the proper tools to cut it the way I would have liked. I was going to throw my old laptop in it but that would have needed me to cut the casing. So I thought I'd do something more fun. Using the door sensor from the microwave and the arduino to read it, I then had it keep track of the score and flash the lights on a score. I kind of want to include the raspberry pi in this project to provide a web interface and play sounds and give a more rewarding play experience. In due time.
