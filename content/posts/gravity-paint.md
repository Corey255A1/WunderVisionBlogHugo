Draw a picture and then watch it get destroyed by gravity!!! Written in C#. Still some glitches, and not really reflective of real life gravity. At this point the pixels themselves don't affect each other except that they can colide. But momentum isn't transfered yet the pixel just stops moving in that direction and velocity brought to 0. Hold down Left mouse to draw points. Right Click to place the point of gravity. That's it so far. Kind of neat effects.
