I recently discovered that GitHub allows you to create a static webpage. This is great, because I can host all of my various javascript based projects on that site and not have to worry about adding them to this site. Check out Corey255A1.github.io! Github is a very main stream code repository. People upload all sorts of open source code and store school projects and things. It gives people an easy way to integrate revision control into their side projects without having to maintain there own servers. Here is the link to the source of my page What is also cool is that now you can check out the Sound Visualizer! So far that is the only demo on there, but there will be more to come! I won't be able to have the server side javascript running, as it is only static webpages. Meaning the only real projects I can demo will be client side javascript apps, but there is plenty of opportunity there.
